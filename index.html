        <h3>A few interesting things about me. I love to read science fiction (my favorite is Frank Herbert's Dune). I am also an avid gamer. I love to play competitive strategy games and first-person shooters. Lastly, I love learning. Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, software engineering, or miscellaneous facts about the universe. On top of recently getting married and graduating with a masters in computer science from UT Dallas, I also recently started working as a senior data scientist at Capital One. My work mainly revolves around utilizing natural language processing to build a more intelligent customer experience.</h3>
